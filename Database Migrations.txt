To add a database change,

1 - change the model
2 - Open the Package Manager Console (Tools > NuGet Package Manager)
    Be sure the directory is the solution folder (dir, cd)
    Be sure ToClipboard is the Default project
3 - Type "add-migration"
4 - Add a name

The name will be CurrentDateAndTime_name

If you get the error, File not found: microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.design, or something similar. 

In the Visual Studio Installer app:
   Be sure you're working with the most up to date Visual Studio, 
   and that .Net Core is enabled in individual features.

   Also be sure the .Net version for this project is enabled as well.

You may also need to run "Update-Package" via the Package Manager Console,
