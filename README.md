# EasyGamePasswords
One of the problems with Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) games, are that they require a person to type a password every time they play it. There's a few solutions to secure passwords, but none of them are pretty. Using a password service, you can have a secure password that looks like it was made from a HASH algorithm, but is hard to type. So the solution is to have a text file to copy from and paste into the password. What is needed is something easy, that'd put the password into the clipboard for you. And while it's at it, launch the game.
