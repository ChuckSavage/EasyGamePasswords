# Easy Game Passwords
One of the problems with Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) games, are that they require a person to type a password every time they play it. There's a few solutions to secure passwords, but none of them are pretty. Using a password service, you can have a secure password that looks like it was made from a HASH algorithm, but is hard to type. A solution is to have a text file to copy from and paste into the password. What is needed is something easy, that'd put the password into the clipboard for you. And while it's at it, launch the game.

Enter JumpLists to Clipboard (ToClipboard)

Jump lists are the right click information that shows up when you right click an icon on your taskbar or start menu. In the image above, it shows a couple items of importance. The FFXIV titled items. Clicking the password version, copies the password I've set on my database via the application, to the clipboard, then launches the application. The other, I've configured only to copy the user name to the clipboard. Since FFXIV stores the user name in its launcher, I don't need it as often.

An editor is provided to adjust the settings.

Closing the editor, sets the jump list items to whichever Jump List was selected in the editor on close.
